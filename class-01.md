Getting Started
<li>1. HTTP defines langauge that will be communicated between the User and Reciever.
<li>2. As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from <link> elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from <script> elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.
<li>3. You can find images from a website like Google then click on images. Then you Right-Click, select Save Image As. Now the image can be used in your website.
<li>4. Strings contain quotaion marks. Numbers do not contain quotation marks
<li>5. Variables are containers that store value. They are important in Javascript because the values being used will make dynamic changes to a website.

  Introduction of HTML
   <li>1. Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
   <li>2. An anatomy of an HTML element contains an opening tag that consists the name of the element, where it begins and takes effect. After the tag are its contents. Lastly, a closing tag marking the end of the element.
   <li>3. An <article> represents a self-contained composition in a document, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable. An <section> is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it.
   <li>4. A typical website contains a header, navigation bar, main content, sidebar and a footer.
   <li>5. Specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in relevant searches.
   <li>6. The element specifies the document's character encoding.

     Semantics
   <li>1. An h1 element has Semantic values, where a span element does not.
   <li>2. The Benefits
    <li>Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings.
    <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
    <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
    <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
    <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.
